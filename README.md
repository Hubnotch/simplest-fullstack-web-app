# SIMPLE FULLSTACK WEB APP

This is a simple web app I made trying to solidify my knowledge of CRUD operations using express and Node.js
It is a web app that allows user to create comments, read comments from the database, update a comment and delete a comment in the database
The Backend is written in nodejs and express
The frontend is written in ejs templating engine in express

-- I look forward to making this app feature rich and responsive
